Here are a few proposed user stories for this project:

* A tool for product managers to better understand the feedback on Twitter from users when a new version is launched.
* A tool for executives to trace the public feedback on Twitter towards a newly announced company policy after the policy is announced.
* A tool for news outlets to dig into Twitters for possible news clue to follow regarding a new event.
